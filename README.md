Particle Simulator:
Welcome to my Particle Simulator project! This project was developed using C++ and OpenFrameworks and is based on the OpenFrameworks Particle example. It was part of a Programming Assignment for my Advanced Programming Course.

The main goal of this project was to enhance my practical programming skills by implementing changes to the base code. This required a solid understanding of advanced programming concepts discussed in class, including object-oriented programming, memory management, and graphical rendering techniques.
